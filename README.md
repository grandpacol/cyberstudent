This is my first-time coding project with GitHub.
It's taking a bit of time to get git working on my chromebook. 
I abandoned Windows and started with Linux (Fedora 9) back in 2008 and have a small amount of CLI experience.
I turned 78 at the beginning of this month (Feb. 2021) and am learning html, css and JS with freecodecamp.
I'm hoping to produce some GitHub Pages in due course with some anecdotes on my experiences in past years.
I have 9 grandchildren - 8 under 12 - and hope they'll find my output amusing and instructive.
Who knows? Some of them might become collaborators with me in the future, as I'm very keen for them to learn coding.
The time available to me to build my web-pages (as well as learning JS) is a bit limited and it may take a while.
